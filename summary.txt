Summary: Do you know what your browser is exactly loading when you visit a webpage? Well, the contemporary Web is a tangled mass of interconnected services, where websites import a range of external resources from various third-party domains. However, the latter can further load resources hosted on other domains. For each website, this creates a dependency chain underpinned by a form of implicit trust between the first-party and transitively connected third-parties. The chain can only be loosely controlled as first-party websites often have little, if any, visibility of where these resources are loaded from. We perform a large-scale study of dependency chains in the Web, to find that around 50% of first-party websites render content that they did not directly load. Although the majority (84.91%) of websites have short dependency chains (below 3 levels), we find websites  implicitly trust on average more than 5% of resources, constituting a chain of dependency which length varies from 6 to 37. Using VirusTotal, an anti-virus tools aggregator, we show that 1.2% of these third-parties are classified as suspicious --- although seemingly small, this limited set of suspicious third-parties have remarkable reach into the wider ecosystem. We investigate the security of the implicitly trusted and loaded resources to find that more than 6.2% of the content the websites load without knowing its origin is malicious, potentially containing malware, exploits, and potentially unwanted programs. Finally, by running sandboxed experiments, we observe a range of activities with the majority of suspicious JavaScript downloading malware; worryingly, we find this propensity is greater among implicitly trusted JavaScripts.
